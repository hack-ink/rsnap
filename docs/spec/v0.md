# rsnap v0 Spec (Prototype)

This repository contains a pure-Rust screenshot prototype targeting macOS first, with a
cross-platform architecture.

## Scope and current behavior

- Overlay starts from the global capture hotkey and runs a fullscreen, non-interactive
  capture layer per monitor.
- Live mode shows HUD widgets near the cursor that track pointer movement.
- Left click freezes the active monitor to a fullscreen screenshot in Frozen mode.
- `Space` copies the frozen PNG to clipboard; `Esc` cancels capture.
- In Frozen mode, a loupe and toolbar are part of the floating HUD set and can still
  interact with pointer movement and redraw.

## v0 goals (must-have)

1. Menubar-only app (no Dock icon) on macOS.
2. Global hotkey starts capture session: `Alt+X` (macOS: Option+X).
3. When the capture session overlay is visible, underlying desktop content MUST NOT be
   interactive.
4. The overlay background should be transparent and non-dimming by default.
5. In live mode, the overlay MUST show a HUD near the cursor with:
   - global cursor coordinates `x,y`
   - pixel color `rgb(r,g,b)` under the cursor
6. The first prototype capture flow is:
   - Hotkey -> live transparent overlay
   - Left click -> freeze the active monitor (the monitor under the cursor) as a fullscreen
     screenshot
   - Space -> copy the frozen fullscreen screenshot PNG to the system clipboard, then exit
   - Esc -> cancel and exit without copying

## HUD, blur, tint and hue controls

Rendering is implemented through three floating widgets:

- Main HUD (live info + action hint)
- Loupe (Alt-held magnified sample)
- Frozen toolbar (only visible in frozen + captured states)

All three are styled using the same HUD styling pipeline.

- Architecture:
  - The capture layer is a transparent fullscreen overlay per monitor for input blocking.
  - The HUD widgets are separate always-on-top, borderless windows that follow the cursor
    and move with cursor tracking.
  - macOS native blur is enabled via native window configuration when Glass is enabled.
    Non-macOS uses the same styling fields and currently applies fake blur work paths.
- Blur control semantics:
  - `Glass HUD` toggles the whole style mode.
  - `Blur` controls blur amount (0..1); 0 disables blur.
  - Blur is independent from opacity in intent: with blur active, alpha is still
    constrained by blur style floor so the blur remains visually present even when overall
    opacity is low.
- Tint semantics:
  - `Tint` is tint intensity (0..1), currently implemented as `hud_milk_amount`.
  - `0` means no color shift, `1` means full hue shift.
- Hue semantics:
  - `Hue` sets target hue in `[0,1]` then rendered as 0-360° in UI.
  - Default is a system-blue sky hue (`0.585`), which corresponds to the default blue tone.

## Control defaults and input behavior

- Default settings:
  - HUD opacity: `0.75`
  - HUD blur: `0.25`
  - Tint amount: `0.0`
  - Hue: `0.585`
  - Alt mode: `Hold`
  - Loupe sample size: `Medium (21x21)`
- Slider semantics:
  - Opacity / Blur / Tint: slider and numeric entry are in `0..100` percentage points.
  - Input accepts integer percent values (`50`) and values without `%` in the same field.
  - Hue input is an integer degree value in `0..360`.
  - The HUD widget controls are disabled when `Glass HUD` is off.

## Cursor tracking and redraw behavior

- Cursor tracking is primarily event-driven from `WindowEvent::CursorMoved`.
- On macOS, overlay windows are configured to receive mouse-move events (native call path),
  and live cursor tracking updates HUD/loupe windows through event-based movement.
- For non-macOS, live cursor polling is used as a fallback to keep redraw/tick flowing.
- In live mode, tracking keeps the HUD aligned and requests redraw for both current monitor
  and previous monitor when crossing monitor boundaries.
- Frozen mode keeps toolbar/loupe/frozen-surface behavior stable and redraw-safe after capture.

## HUD/toolbar lifecycle

- All floating HUD windows are created at overlay start.
- In Frozen mode, loupe/toolbar visibility follows Alt + current mode state and
  `show_frozen_capture` state.

## Non-goals (v0)

- Region selection (drag to select).
- Window selection (click to select a window).
- Annotation/editor UI, save-to-disk workflows, pinning, and advanced editing tools.
