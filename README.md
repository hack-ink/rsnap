## Feature Highlights

- Menubar-only app (no Dock icon) on macOS.
- Global hotkey: `Alt+X` (macOS: Option+X).
- Transparent capture-session overlay that blocks desktop interaction.
- HUD near the cursor showing global `x,y` and `rgb(r,g,b)`.
- Left click freezes the active monitor as a fullscreen screenshot.
- Space copies the frozen screenshot PNG to the clipboard and exits.
- Esc cancels and exits.

## Status

Prototype / in active development.
